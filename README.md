## OVERVIEW OF OUR GAME: 
 In our game “Reign of Rebels” the player takes on the role of a rebel aiming to overthrow the ruler and place their leader on the throne. To achieve this, they must embark on a quest to steal three sacred objects – a Sceptre, a Robe, and a Crown – each held in a different location, which would be the Dungeons, Main Hall and the Throne Room, each guarded by a series of obstacles and trials. 

Each object is essentially a level in the game, once the player manages to obtain an object required to overthrow the ruler, they move onto another stage where they repeat the whole process, except they manage to acquire another piece of the three objects; until they get to the final stage, where they face the King (who is the ultimate boss of the game), and secure the King crown.

## ROLES & INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
**Han: Main Coder/ Maps Coder-**
My role for this project is to create and code the main map of the game ensuring that each level and aspect of the map is in order, in terms of its assets and properties. Furthermore, I have the role of main coder where I manage and troubleshoot any issues with our code.

I have contributed in coding with the prototype of the game's tilemap and have used some of the map designs created by Amelia, in order, to add the graphics of the map. I took this from the week 15, 16 and 17 workshops. I have also managed to fix some errors such as there was an issue with player walking through walls, which has now been fixed. Furthermore, I have also organised the coding so it is easier to read and understand. 

Overall, I have so far enjoyed experimenting with the code and I find it satisfying when I can solve issues and problems within the code. 

**Imogen: Designer for enemy sprites/ Coder for enemy sprites-** 
For the project I have taken the role of both designing and coding all the enemies, which will consist of goblins, knights and a king as a final boss.

I have so far created sprites for the goblin enemies, and coded their movement so they target the player. Additionally I have created an animation cycle for the sprites so they face the direction they are walking and move their legs.

Overall I find the coding a satisfying process, and have enjoyed creating the sprite designs.

**Allyssa: Story writer/Coder for player, scroll message screen-**
I have taken on the role of creating the narrative of the game where I sort of proposed the basis of the backstory of the entire game, which is essentially the whole idea of a rebellion attempting the overthrow the king. But in order to do this, they must obtain these three objects which are each contained in three different locations within the king's fortress. 

In order to introduce this narrative to the players of the game, I have created a scroll which will be presented right before the player enters the first level of the game, and it contains a message from the leader of this rebellion group, explaining to the player the main objective of the game and what they'll be facing in order to achieve the goal of overthrowing the king. 

I have also contributed to coding the moving character on the tilemap, by importing the character designed by Amelia into VS code and implementing some of the code learnt from Week 17 to achieve this, and have coded it so that when the player left clicks, the character is holding its dagger, which can later be used to defeat the enemies, when we develop the game further.

Overall, I have enjoyed the process of creating the narrative a lot, as well as coding both the scoll message page and the moving character.

**Suha: Designer for items/ Coder for Items, some dialogue-**
For this project I have taken the role as the designer and coder for items.  Firstly, I have created visually appealing items using pixel art style, by making use of the ibis Paint X software. These items include a crown, a cape and sceptre. 

In terms of coding, I have coded the movement (e.g., floating) and position of the items within the game as well as a click function which will trigger a text box (with time limit appearance wise).

Additionally, I have taken on the responsibility of creating item dialogues to bring life and personality to each item - for example when an item is found, a popup message will appear to inform the user about the item and their progress in the game. 

I have also taken on the role of coding and working on the game over screen, where once the character fails to obtain the items/is taken out by an obstacle or enemy sprite, the screen will appear to inform the player that they have to try again or exit/go to start page. "play again" and "main menu" buttons but in red/gray diff contrasting colours which will redirect the player.

Overall, I am thoroughly enjoying every aspect of working on this project. The combination of designing, coding, and crafting narratives has been a engaging and fun experience so far despite some issues with image pathways I have had (now resolved) and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing all the code and the hard work of the group come together - the final game!

**Anna: Designer for assets/ Coder for Story, Map Assets, some dialogue-**
My role for this project has been working on the environmental assets to be placed on the tiles, such as skeleton barriers in the dungeon, banners on the walls, and treasure chests. 

I have also taken on the role of coding the dialogue function, which has yet to be implemented in the prototype as the dialogue will need to be triggered based on the player's location. The dialogue function takes in a pre-defined list of strings to be said and shows each character within the dialogue box sequentially, so as to mimic speech. 

I have also assisted in the coding for the menu screen, in which I have combined the "Play" button into the scrolling text screen.

Overall, I have enjoyed implementing features into the game that help bring it to life and find seeing the impact very satisfying.

**Amelia: Designer for character, tile maps/ Coder for Intro screen, story-**
I have been working on the tile maps, main character, menu and introduction screen. These are all done from scratch but have heavy influence from games such as ‘The Escapist’ and ‘Stardew Valley’. I spent most my time looking at these games and analysing the details which are portrayed through different colour palletes such as shadows, pillars and cracks in flooring; aswell as lighter shades for sheen on clean flooring. I had alot of fun creating these tiles maps as it included the combination of creative freedom aswell as arcitectual things when it came to measurements and precise details. I worked on coding the main menu buttons that will be implimented aswell as a game over screen!

Overall so far, I have loved the balance between intuitive code learning with my creative abilities and I have been able to have fun whilst learning code ;I am slowly becoming comfortble with.

## THEMES
Theme of Dungeons, Rebellion, Monarchy, etc. We're essentially aiming for a dark, scary atmosphere/mood within the game. 

## GAME DESIGN: 
**Level Structures:** The game consists of multiple levels, each representing a different area within the ruler's fortress. One of the levels include the Dungeons, which is where the player will face the task of defeating several enemies and obstacles in order to obtain the sceptre. After successfully getting through this level, the player then moves onto the next level, which would be the main hall, where they would again have to face multiple enemies and obstacles protecting the cape. Once they get to the final level, which is the throne room, they are then not only faced with the enemies and obstacles, they are also faced with the King, who is the ultimate boss of the entire game. 

**Movement/Combat:** The player will be able to use the WASD keys to move the character around; and since they will be engaging in combat with various enemies, they would be able to use a knife by clicking on their mouse to aim and deal damage to those attacking them. Players may also potentially deal damage or be poisoned by various objects/assets scattered around the map, and would be able to overcome these obstacles by spamming a key on the keyboard. They player will have around 3 lives, before they end up dying and restarting the game again.
