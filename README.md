## OVERVIEW OF OUR GAME: 
 In our game “Reign of Rebels” the player takes on the role of a rebel aiming to overthrow the ruler and place their leader on the throne. To achieve this, they must embark on a quest to steal three sacred objects – a Sceptre, a Robe, and a Crown – each held in a different location, which would be the Dungeons, Main Hall and the Throne Room, each guarded by a series of obstacles and trials. 

Each object is essentially a level in the game, once the player manages to obtain an object required to overthrow the ruler, they move onto another stage where they repeat the whole process, except they manage to acquire another piece of the three objects; until they get to the final stage, where they face the King (who is the ultimate boss of the game), and secure the King crown.

## THEMES
Theme of Dungeons, Rebellion, Monarchy, etc. We're essentially aiming for a dark, scary atmosphere/mood within the game. 

## GAME DESIGN: 
**Level Structures:** The game consists of multiple levels, each representing a different area within the ruler's fortress. One of the levels include the Dungeons, which is where the player will face the task of defeating several enemies and obstacles in order to obtain the sceptre. After successfully getting through this level, the player then moves onto the next level, which would be the main hall, where they would again have to face multiple enemies and obstacles protecting the cape. Once they get to the final level, which is the throne room, they are then not only faced with the enemies and obstacles, they are also faced with the King, who is the ultimate boss of the entire game. 

**Movement/Combat:** The player will be able to use the WASD keys to move the character around; and since they will be engaging in combat with various enemies, they would be able to use a knife by left clicking to aim and deal damage to those attacking them. Players may also deal damage or have instant death by various objects/assets scattered around the map, if they step on it. They player will have around 3 lives, before they end up dying and restarting the game again.
