## OVERVIEW OF OUR GAME: 
 In our game “Reign of Rebels” the player takes on the role of a rebel aiming to overthrow the ruler and place their leader on the throne. To achieve this, they must embark on a quest to steal three sacred objects – a Sceptre, a Robe, and a Crown – each held in a different location, which would be the Dungeons, Main Hall and the Throne Room, each guarded by a series of obstacles and trials. 

Each object is essentially a level in the game, once the player manages to obtain an object required to overthrow the ruler, they move onto another stage where they repeat the whole process, except they manage to acquire another piece of the three objects; until they get to the final stage, where they face the King (who is the ultimate boss of the game), and secure the King crown.
